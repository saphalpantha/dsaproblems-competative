# C++ DSA Practice

This repository contains a collection of **C++ programs and exercises** focused on data structures and algorithms. It includes implementations and practice code for arrays, recursion, stacks, bit manipulation, and commonly asked algorithmic problems such as Two Sum and finding duplicate elements.

The projects are intended for learning, practicing, and improving problem-solving skills using C++ and STL.
